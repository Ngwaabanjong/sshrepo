Basically git can communicate with GITHUb over https or SSH

Method1
When git is connected to github over https, you will use
Username and personal access token to push files into repo by authenticating the user.

Method 2:
************************
When git is connect to github over SSH

Step 1:
For this process on the local machine you will have to generate :

SSH private key
SSH public key

The command to generate SSH key is: ssh-keygen

Come out of your repo to your home directory

$ pwd
$ ssh-keygen

Press enter key 3 times

The key will be generated and public key will be in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Get the public key content

$ cat /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

You will see the public key

You will then copy the public key 

ssh-rsa AAvNPGoj6mk+mW4lofMejkYeC/E5Yzhnx/Yn4LvP1ptXzzg1WOLICe//PJ7QI
n7lCuQa79ce+PSvWOS7auYQN+8SwNC2U+oW/ZbK1NnsPvD/IcMyjyRyFshuEeHuL+WY7wK
f+QBmGUlFlQuP root@ip-172-31-22-204.us-east-2.compute.internal

Go to GITHUb and paste the public key in its Settings

GITHUB -> Settings -> leftside click on SSH & GPG keys -> click on new SSh key 
Give title of key 
Copy the key in next box 
Save 

By this method github now identifies you local machine as a authenticated user
Now you don't have to give any username or personal access token while pushing files into github
If you want to push your files over SSH, then the remote URL will be different form https

The remote URL for the repo will be like this: git@github.com:Sonal0409/myproject.git

Now on your CLI run$ git add remote origin git@github.com:Sonal0409/myproject.git

Create a remote repo and pull it.

run $ git pull origin master

End
